        <p>Sahyadri was conceived as a dream; a dream to make healthcare AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE, AND ACCOUNTABLE the community at large.</p>
        <p>Yet these were not the only drivers… We, from the very first day of our existence, kept the ‘Customer’ at the centerfold of our organization. It is building the trust with our customer that has always driven us to be the best – at infrastructure, at technology, at our physician team, at our patient care team, at our processes, and at our emotions.</p>
        <p>From a humble beginning to the largest chain across Maharashtra, the journey has been challenging. And with every challenge we faced, Sahyadri team always dug in its heels and has overcome the challenges with their enthusiasm – enthusiasm to make Sahyadri a compassionate healthcare organization – building a bond of trust with its customers… I could not thank my team enough for their contribution in the development of this organization.</p>
        <p>Sahyadri is poised now to take on the next challenge – developing the organization into Centers of Excellence in various disciplines. We have achieved a center of excellence status in a large number of specialties and super specialties, yet being the best at everything is the goal that we chase.</p>
